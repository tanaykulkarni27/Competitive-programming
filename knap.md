Dr. Patel has N stacks of plates. Each stack contains K plates. Each plate has a positive beauty value, describing how beautiful it looks.

Dr. Patel would like to take exactly P plates to use for dinner tonight. If he would like to take a plate in a stack, he must also take all of the plates above it in that stack as well.

Help Dr. Patel pick the P plates that would maximize the total sum of beauty values.
