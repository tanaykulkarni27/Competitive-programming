<p>how to find how many time sequence present in the list</p> 
<p id="vis" style="visibility: hidden;">for Example:<br>
    3 #Case No (No of times you are running the code)<br>
    6 3 # 6 length of list and 3 is length of sequence (sequence will be generated automatically) <br>
    3 2 1 3 2 1 # '3 2 1 3 2 1' is the list in which i have to check the sequence

<p>Isyana is given the number of visitors at her local theme park on N consecutive days. The number of visitors on the i-th day is Vi.<br> A day is record breaking if it satisfies both of the following conditions:<br>
The number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of visitors on each of the previous days.<br>
Either it is the last day, or the number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of visitors on the following day.<br>
Note that the very first day could be a record breaking day!<br>
Please help Isyana find out the number of record breaking days.</p>
<h1>Longest Arrithmatic.py</h1>
<p>An arithmetic array is an array that contains at least two integers and the differences between consecutive integers are equal.<br> For example, [9, 10], [3, 3, 3], and [9, 7, 5, 3] <br>are arithmetic arrays, while [1, 3, 3, 7], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 4] are not arithmetic arrays.<br>

Sarasvati has an array of N non-negative integers. The i-th integer of the array is Ai.<br> She wants to choose a contiguous arithmetic subarray <br>from her array that has the maximum length.<br>Please help her to determine the length of the longest contiguous arithmetic subarray.</p>
