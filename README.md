    3 #Case No (No of times you are running the code)<br>
    6 3 # 6 length of list and 3 is length of sequence (sequence will be generated automatically) <br>

<p>Isyana is given the number of visitors at her local theme park on N consecutive days. The number of visitors on the i-th day is Vi.<br> A day is record breaking if it satisfies both of the following conditions:<br>
The number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of visitors on each of the previous days.<br>
Either it is the last day, or the number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of visitors on the following day.<br>
Note that the very first day could be a record breaking day!<br>

Please help Isyana find out the number of record breaking days.</p>
