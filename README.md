<h1><a href="https://github.com/tanaykulkarni27/Python-Coding/blob/master/sequence.py">Sequence.Py</a></h1>
<p>how to find how many time sequence present in the list</p> 
<p id="vis" style="visibility: hidden;">for Example:<br>
    3 #Case No (No of times you are running the code)<br>
    6 3 # 6 length of list and 3 is length of sequence (sequence will be generated automatically) <br>
    3 2 1 3 2 1 # '3 2 1 3 2 1' is the list in which i have to check the sequence

<h1><a href="https://github.com/tanaykulkarni27/Python-Coding/blob/master/Record%20Breaker.py">Record Breaker.Py</a></h1>
<p>Isyana is given the number of visitors at her local theme park on N consecutive days. The number of visitors on the i-th day is Vi.<br> A day is record breaking if it satisfies both of the following conditions:<br>
The number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of visitors on each of the previous days.<br>
Either it is the last day, or the number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of visitors on the following day.<br>
Note that the very first day could be a record breaking day!<br>
Please help Isyana find out the number of record breaking days.</p>
<h1><a href="https://github.com/tanaykulkarni27/Python-Coding/blob/master/Longest%20Arrithmatic.py">Longest Arithmatic.py</a></h1>
<p>An arithmetic array is an array that contains at least two integers and the differences between consecutive integers are equal.<br> For example, [9, 10], [3, 3, 3], and [9, 7, 5, 3] <br>are arithmetic arrays, while [1, 3, 3, 7], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 4] are not arithmetic arrays.<br>

Sarasvati has an array of N non-negative integers. The i-th integer of the array is Ai.<br> She wants to choose a contiguous arithmetic subarray <br>from her array that has the maximum length.<br>Please help her to determine the length of the longest contiguous arithmetic subarray.</p>
<h1><a href="https://github.com/tanaykulkarni27/Python-Coding/blob/master/Atm%20Queue.py">Atm Queue</a></h1>
<p>There are N people numbered from 1 to N, standing in a queue to withdraw money from an ATM. The queue is formed in ascending order of their number.<br> The person numbered i wants to withdraw amount Ai. The maximum amount a person can withdraw at a time is X. If they need more<br> money than X, they need to go stand at the end of the queue and wait for their turn in line. A person leaves the queue once they have withdrawn the<br> required amount.
<br>
You need to find the order in which all the people leave the queue.</p>
<h1><a href="https://github.com/tanaykulkarni27/Python-Coding/blob/master/Judging%20System.py">Judging System</a></h1>
<p>
This problem is a well-known classic; we present it primarily as an opportunity for you to try out the interactive judging system.<br>

We are thinking of an integer P within the range (A,B] — that is, A < P ≤ B.<br> You have N tries to guess our number. After each guess that is not correct,<br>we will tell you whether P is higher or lower than your guess.

<h1><a href="https://github.com/tanaykulkarni27/Python-Coding/blob/master/training.py">Training.py</a></h1>
<p>
As the football coach at your local school, you have been tasked with picking a team of exactly P students to represent your school. There are N<br>
students for you to pick from. The i-th student has a skill rating Si, which is a positive integer indicating how skilled they are.<br>
You have decided that a team is fair if it has exactly P students on it and they all have the same skill rating. That way, everyone plays as a team.<br>
Initially, it might not be possible to pick a fair team, so you will give some of the students one-on-one coaching. It takes one hour of coaching to<br>
increase the skill rating of any student by 1.

The competition season is starting very soon (in fact, the first match has<br> already started!), so you'd like to find the minimum number of hours of coaching you need to give before you are able to pick a fair team.

<h1><a href="https://github.com/tanaykulkarni27/Python-Coding/blob/master/Bus%20Routes.py">Bus Routes.py</a></h1>
<p>
Bucket is planning to make a very long journey across the countryside by bus. Her journey consists of N bus routes, numbered from 1 to N in the<br>
order she must take them. The buses themselves are very fast, but do not run often. The i-th bus route only runs every Xi days.<br>
More specifically, she can only take the i-th bus on day Xi, 2Xi, 3Xi and so on. Since the buses are very fast, she can take multiple buses on the same day.<br>
Bucket must finish her journey by day D, but she would like to start the journey as late as possible. What is the latest day she could take the first bus,<br>
and still finish her journey by day D?
<br>
It is guaranteed that it is possible for Bucket to finish her journey by day D.

<h1><a href="https://github.com/tanaykulkarni27/Python-Coding/tree/master">Yoghurt.py</a></h1>
<p>
Yogurt can be a nutritious part of an appetizer, main course, or dessert, but it must be consumed before it expires, and it might expire quickly! Moreover,<br>
different cups of yogurt might expire on different days.<br>
Lucy loves yogurt, and she has just bought N cups of yogurt, but she is worried that she might not be able to consume all of them before they expire.<br>
The i-th cup of yogurt will expire Ai days from today, and a cup of yogurt cannot be consumed on the day it expires, or on any day after that.<br>
As much as Lucy loves yogurt, she can still only consume at most K cups of yogurt each day. What is the largest number of cups of yogurt that <br>
she can consume, starting from today?</p>
<h1><a href="https://github.com/tanaykulkarni27/Python-Coding/blob/master/product%20triplet.py">Product triplet.py</a></h1>
<p>
    Given N integers A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sub>N</sub>, count the number of triplets (x, y, z)<br> (with 1 ≤ x < y < z ≤ N) such that at least one of the following
    <br>is true:<br>
    A<sub>x</sub> = A<sub>y</sub> × A<sub>z</sub>, and/or<br>
    A<sub>y</sub> = A<sub>x</sub> × A<sub>z</sub>, and/or<br>
    A<sub>z</sub> = A<sub>x</sub> × A<sub>y</sub>

Professor Shekhu has another problem for Akki today. He has given him three<br>
positive integers A, N and P and wants him to calculate the remainder when AN! is<br>
divided by P. As usual, N! denotes the product of the first N positive integers<br>
