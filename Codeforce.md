For a given array a consisting of n integers and a given integer m find if it is possible to reorder elements of the array A in 
such a way that ∑<sup>n</sup><sub>i=1</sub>∑<sup>n</sup><sub>j=i</sub>A<sub>j</sub>/2 is equal to m? It is forbidden to delete elements as well as insert new elements. Please note that no rounding occurs during division, for example, 5/2=2.5
if ∑<sup>n</sup><sub>i=1</sub>∑<sup>n</sup><sub>j=i</sub>A<sub>j</sub>/2 is equal to m is True print YES else print NO
