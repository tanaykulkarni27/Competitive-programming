<h1><a href="https://github.com/tanaykulkarni27/Competitive-programming/recoderC.py">reorder</a></h1>
For a given array A consisting of n integers and a given integer m find if it is possible to reorder elements of the array A in 
such a way that ∑<sup>n</sup><sub>i=1</sub>∑<sup>n</sup><sub>j=i</sub> A<sub>j</sub>/2 is equal to m? It is forbidden to delete elements as well as insert new elements. Please note that no rounding occurs during division, for example, 5/2=2.5<br>
if ∑<sup>n</sup><sub>i=1</sub>∑<sup>n</sup><sub>j=i</sub> A<sub>j</sub>/2 is equal to m is True print YES else print NO

<h1><a href="https://github.com/tanaykulkarni27/Competitive-programming/blob/master/Kids%20SeatingC.py">Kids Seating</a></h1>
Today the kindergarten has a new group of n kids who need to be seated at the dinner table. The chairs at the table are numbered from 1 to 4n. Two kids can't sit on the same chair. It is known that two kids who sit on chairs with numbers a and b (a≠b) will indulge if:

gcd(a,b)=1 or,
a divides b or b divides a.
gcd(a,b) — the maximum number x such that a is divisible by x and b is divisible by x.

For example, if n=3 and the kids sit on chairs with numbers 2, 3, 4, then they will indulge since 4 is divided by 2 and gcd(2,3)=1. If kids sit on chairs with numbers 4, 6, 10, then they will not indulge.

The teacher really doesn't want the mess at the table, so she wants to seat the kids so there are no 2 of the kid that can indulge. More formally, she wants no pair of chairs a and b that the kids occupy to fulfill the condition above.

Since the teacher is very busy with the entertainment of the kids, she asked you to solve this problem.

Sasha likes investigating different math objects, for example, magic squares. But Sasha understands that magic squares have already been studied by hundreds of people, so he sees no sense of studying them further. Instead, he invented his own type of square — a prime square.

A square of size n×n is called prime if the following three conditions are held simultaneously:

all numbers on the square are non-negative integers not exceeding 105;
there are no prime numbers in the square;
sums of integers in each row and each column are prime numbers.
Sasha has an integer n. He asks you to find any prime square of size n×n. Sasha is absolutely sure such squares exist, so just help him!

One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

<h1><a href="https://github.com/tanaykulkarni27/Competitive-programming/blob/master/Way%20To%20Long%20Words.py">Way to long words</a></h2>
Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.

Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.

This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.

Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and "internationalization» will be spelt as "i18n".

You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.
