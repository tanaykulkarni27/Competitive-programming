Ron read a book about boring numbers. According to the book, a positive number is called boring if all of the digits at even positions in the number are even and all of the digits at odd positions are odd. The digits are enumerated from left to right starting from 1. For example, the number 1478 is boring as the odd positions include the digits {1, 7} which are odd and even positions include the digits {4, 8} which are even.

Given two numbers L and R, Ron wants to count how many numbers in the range [L, R] (L and R inclusive) are boring. Ron is unable to solve the problem, hence he needs your help.
<a href="https://github.com/tanaykulkarni27/Python-Coding/blob/master/perfect.py"><h1>Perfect Subarray</h1></a>
Cristobal has an array of N (possibly negative) integers. The i-th integer in his array is Ai. A contiguous non-empty subarray of Cristobal's array is perfect if its total sum is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that is the product of a non-negative integer with itself. For example, the first five perfect squares are 0, 1, 4, 9 and 16.

How many subarrays are perfect? Two subarrays are different if they start or end at different indices in the array, even if the subarrays contain the same values in the same order.

<p>
  You are in charge of deploying robots to harvest Kickium from a nearby asteroid. Robots are not designed to work as a team, so only one robot can harvest at any point of time. A single robot can be deployed for up to K units of time in a row before it returns for calibration, regardless of how much time it spends on harvesting during that period. Harvesting can only be done during specific time intervals. These time intervals do not overlap. Given K and the time intervals in which harvesting is allowed, what is the minimum number of robot deployments required to harvest at all possible times?

<h1><a href="https://github.com/tanaykulkarni27/Python-Coding/blob/master/Planets.py">Planet Distance</a></h1>
<p>
    There are N planets in the universe, and Google's Space division has installed N vacuum tubes through which you can travel from one planet to another. The tubes are bidirectional; travelers may use a tube between two planets to travel from either of those planets to the other. Each vacuum tube connects two planets and no two vacuum tubes connect the same pair of planets. These tubes connect the planets such that it is possible to travel from any planet to any other planet using one or more of them. Some of these tubes are connected such that there exists exactly one cycle in the universe. Google has hidden gifts in all the planets that are part of this cycle. Now, Google wants to know how far away each of the planets in the universe is from the gifts.

Your task is to find the minimum distance (in terms of the number of vacuum tubes) between each planet and a planet that is part of the cycle. Planets that are part of the cycle are assumed to be at distance 0.

<p>
Anna has a row of N blocks, each with exactly one letter from A to Z written on it. The blocks are numbered 1, 2, ..., N from left to right.

Today, she is learning about palindromes. A palindrome is a string that is the same written forwards and backwards. For example, ANNA, RACECAR, AAA and X are all palindromes, while AB, FROG and YOYO are not.

Bob wants to test how well Anna understands palindromes, and will ask her Q questions. The i-th question is: can Anna use all of the blocks numbered from Li to Ri, inclusive, rearranging them if necessary, to form a palindrome? After each question, Anna puts the blocks back in their original positions.

Please help Anna by finding out how many of Bob's questions she can answer "yes" to.

<p>
Banny has just bought a new programmable robot. Eager to test his coding skills, he has placed the robot in a grid of squares with R rows (numbered 1 to R from north to south) and C columns (numbered 1 to C from west to east). The square in row r and column c is denoted (r, c).

Initially the robot starts in the square (SR, SC). Banny will give the robot N instructions. Each instruction is one of N, S, E or W, instructing the robot to move one square north, south, east or west respectively.

If the robot moves into a square that it has been in before, the robot will continue moving in the same direction until it reaches a square that it has not been in before. Banny will never give the robot an instruction that will cause it to move out of the grid.

Can you help Banny determine which square the robot will finish in, after following the N instructions?

Mike has a square matrix with N rows and N columns. Cell (i,j) denotes the cell present at row i and column j. Cell (1,1) denotes the top left corner of the matrix. Each cell has some amount of coins associated with it and Mike can collect them only if he visits that cell. Ci,j represents the number of coins in cell with row i and column j. From a cell (i,j), Mike can decide to go to cell (i+1,j+1) or cell (i-1,j-1), as long as the cell lies within the boundaries of the matrix and has not been visited yet. He can choose to start the journey from any cell and choose to stop at any point. Mike wants to maximize the number of coins he can collect. Please help him determine the maximum number of coins he can collect.

<p>
Ksenia is very fond of reading so she kicks off each day by reading a fragment from her favourite book before starting with the rest of her morning routine. A fragment is simply a substring of the text. Ksenia is somewhat superstitious and believes that her day will be lucky if the fragment she reads starts with the string KICK, then goes on with 0 or more characters, and eventually ends with the string START, even if the overall fragment makes little sense.

Given the text of the book, count the number of different lucky fragments that Ksenia can read before the book gets old and she needs to buy another one. Two fragments are considered to be different if they start or end at different positions in the text, even if the fragments read the same. Also note that different lucky fragments may overlap.

As the football coach at your local school, you have been tasked with picking a team of exactly P students to represent your school. There are N<br>
students for you to pick from. The i-th student has a skill rating S<sub>i</sub>, which is a positive integer indicating how skilled they are.<br>
You have decided that a team is fair if it has exactly P students on it and they all have the same skill rating. That way, everyone plays as a team.<br>
Initially, it might not be possible to pick a fair team, so you will give some of the students one-on-one coaching. It takes one hour of coaching to<br>
increase the skill rating of any student by 1.
